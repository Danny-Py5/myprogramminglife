        <h2>Issues and how i fixed them</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <h4>I faced <em>Deceptive site ahead error: Showing in all my hosted websites on my github</em></h4>

                <img src="imgs/chrome-error___chromewebdata_.png" alt="">
                <p>
                    This error gave me a lot of concern and feel tired but I threw it to facebook in
                    many programming groups. I got a lot of feedbacks but none of them seems to solve the issue. <strong>BUT</strong> chatGPT helpd me out. It directed me to a google website where click on a review button after i had described that my website has no bad links again that i have fixed them. But i never fixed enything i just give it a try to just say such. And boom :) my website got resolved. google later sent a mail to me that:

            <li>Most times, i found it difficult to grasp the JS course from <mark>supersimpledev</mark>
                most expecially when am trying to understand the exercises :(
